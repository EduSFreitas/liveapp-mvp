# LiveApp-frontend

This application allows to read the discord chat of some channel, using [WidgetBot](https://widgetbot.io/) while doing other things. \
In other words, it is an *always on top* application, which allows to do some other things like programming a thing in an IntelliJ-based IDE but to see the chat simultaneously.

**The primary purpose of this app is to be used while streaming live, on discord!**

## WARNING!

This application is **very bloated**: it is literally just 16 lines of HTML and 4 of JavaScript but weighs something around 160MB. \
It has been made in less than an hour, to get **a quick MVP**.

**We plan to make a better application in future!**

## How to use

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/readthedocs-fr/LiveApp-frontend/releases), unzip it with [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) and run liveapp.exe
